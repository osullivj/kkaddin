# kkaddin
kkaddin is a bare bones minimal C# RTD server based on Kenny Kerr's code. It's intended to be simple boilerplate that makes for a good starting point for anyone coding an RTD server from scratch. There's great content on Kenny's web site (http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/Rtd3) and John Greenan's too (http://blog.alignment-systems.com/2014/05/excel-rtd-server-implementation-in.html). However, I couldn't find a single, simple download of a minimal implementation. So here it is. Take a look at the main comment at the top of RTDServer.cs for build and run tips.
